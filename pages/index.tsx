            <h3>Speed</h3>
            <p>
              We build the fastest websites on the web using pre-built pages
              served statically over content delivery networks (CDN)
              geographically closest to your audience.

            <h3>Security</h3>
            <p>
              We host your site as a collection of static assets located on a
              CDN. Since server connections are removed from the equation,
              you're less vulnerable to attacks.

            <h3>Scale</h3>
            <p>
              Scale your site with ease without the hefty price tag. Serving
              static assets over CDN results in big gains over traditional
              servers as your audience grows.

        <h2>Traditional web architecture is outdated</h2>
        <p className='emphasis'>
          In today's increasingly-crowded and rapidly-changing web, websites
          need to be more flexible and nimble to stand out from the pack.
        </p>
        <p>
          Content management systems (CMS) like Wordpress, Drupal, Wix, and
          Squarespace have ruled the web since the early 2000's. They use a
          traditional web architecture where content and display are managed
          together. This makes them convenient but also limited. Plugins can
          extended functionality, but this becomes complex, slow, and harder to
          maintain at scale.
        </p>
      </Section>
      <Section id='discover-part2'>
        <h2>The future of the web is decoupled</h2>
        <p className='emphasis'>
          A new decoupled approach has emerged and it is changing the way we
          think about and build websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a decoupled system, the content is separate from the display. This
          allows you to choose the "best in breed" solution for each component
          of your website. This is akin to having a hand-picked team of
          specialists working in concert together, each performing their own
          task with the highest degree of competancy. Because decoupled websites
          are highly optimized, the costs to maintain, secure, and scale are
          lower than traditional CMS solutions.
        </p>
      </Section>
      <Section id='discover-part3'>
        <h2>The Jamstack revolution</h2>
        <p>
          The name given to this decoupled approach is the Jamstack. Jamstack
          stands for Javascript, APIs, and Markup. These three terms represent
          the major components of a Jamstack website. Javascript handles the
          dynamic functionality, APIs provide access to the CMS and business
          logic, and Markup represents the user interface which is compiled at
          build time and served statically via CDN.
        </p>
        <h3>The benefits of Jamstack</h3>
        <p>
          The benefits of Jamstack are undeniably impressive: better
          performance, lock-tight security, unlimited flexibility and
          scalability, portability, and maintainability. Not only that, but a
          traditional CMS like Wordpress (or any CMS) can still be part of the
          solution. The Jamstack approach isnâ€™t right for every situation, but
          if your needs extend beyond a simple blog or landing page style site,
          then Jamstack could be a game-changer for you.

            <p>
              With over two decades of web design experience, I understand the
              confusion and apprehension that comes with building a web presence
              because I've been there. Between the hosting, design, content
              creation, SEO, and security, it can be an overwhelming process but
              I'm here to guide you through it.
            </p>
            <p>
              My goal is for your website to become the cornerstone of your
              business. I help you get there through a proven, strategy-first
              approach that clarifies your message, connects with your audience,
              and guides them to action.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm a solo designer backed by a professional network of
              specialized experts, so you get the personalized and caring
              service of a freelancer without the schedule delays, and the
              horsepower of an agency without feeling like a number.
