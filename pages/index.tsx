              We build the fastest websites on the web using pre-built pages
              served statically over content delivery networks (CDN)
              geographically closest to your audience.

            <p>
              We host your site as a collection of static assets located on a
              CDN. Since server connections are removed from the equation,
              you're less vulnerable to attacks.

              Scale your site with ease without the hefty price tag. Serving
              static assets over CDN results in big gains over traditional
              servers as your audience grows.

        <h2>Traditional web architecture is outdated</h2>
        <DiscoverLeft>
          <div>
            <p className='emphasis'>
              In today's increasingly-crowded and rapidly-changing web, websites
              need to be more flexible and nimble to stand out from the pack.
            </p>
            <p className='paragraph'>
              Content management systems (CMS) like Wordpress, Drupal, Wix, and
              Squarespace have ruled the web since the early 2000's. They use a
              traditional web architecture where content and display are managed
              together. This makes them convenient but also limited. Plugins can
              extended functionality, but this becomes complex, slow, and harder
              to maintain at scale.

            <h2>The future of the web is decoupled</h2>
            <p className='emphasis'>
              A new decoupled approach has emerged and it is changing the way we
              think about and build websites.
            </p>
            <p className='paragraph'>
              In a decoupled system, the content is separate from the display.
              This allows you to choose the "best in breed" solution for each
              component of your website. This is akin to having a hand-picked
              team of specialists working in concert together, each performing
              their own task with the highest degree of competancy. Because
              decoupled websites are highly optimized, the costs to maintain,
              secure, and scale are lower than traditional CMS solutions.

            <h2>The Jamstack revolution</h2>
            <p className='paragraph'>
              The name given to this decoupled approach is the Jamstack.
              Jamstack stands for Javascript, APIs, and Markup. These three
              terms represent the major components of a Jamstack website.
              Javascript handles the dynamic functionality, APIs provide access
              to the CMS and business logic, and Markup represents the user
              interface which is compiled at build time and served statically
              via CDN.
            </p>
            <h3>The benefits of Jamstack</h3>
            <p className='paragraph'>
              The benefits of Jamstack are undeniably impressive: better
              performance, lock-tight security, unlimited flexibility and
              scalability, portability, and maintainability. Not only that, but
              a traditional CMS like Wordpress (or any CMS) can still be part of
              the solution. The Jamstack approach isn't right for every
              situation, but if your needs extend beyond a simple blog or
              landing page style site, then Jamstack could be a game-changer for
              you.

            </p>
            <h3>Lower maintenance cost</h3>
            <p>
              Jamstack sites are pre-generated, so they are simple to host and
              maintain. No constant plugin and software updates to make sure
              your site stays secure.

            <h3>Scale without limits</h3>
